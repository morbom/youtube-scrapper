## Youtube scrapper :tada: :rocket:
A YouTube scraper is a tool or script that extracts data from YouTube. It can collect various types of information, such as video titles, descriptions, view counts, likes, comments, channels, and more. YouTube scrapers are commonly used to gather insights for research, content analysis, trend tracking, or to automate data collection for applications. They work by interacting with YouTube's publicly available web pages or API, scraping relevant HTML elements or API responses to extract the required data. Depending on the scraper, it may also download video metadata, playlists, or comments in bulk.

## Steps to use
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` this will install all the required packages
- ```python -u main.py``` to run the script
